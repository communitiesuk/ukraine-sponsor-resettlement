      <p>Hosting can be a very rewarding experience, but there are some important things you need to think about carefully before continuing:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the additional household costs with more people living in your home</li>
        <li>communicating with guests who don't speak your first language fluently</li>
        <li>changes in your household dynamics when sharing your home with guests</li>
        <li>differences in living habits, including household tasks and eating preferences</li>
